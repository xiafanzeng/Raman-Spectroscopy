"""
This module allows for baseline subtraction using polynomial subtraction at a user-specified
degree, peak detection using scipy.signal find_peaks module, and then utilizes
Lorentzian fitting of spectra data, enabling extraction of full-width, half-max peak data.
Note that Lorentzian fitting was chosen explicitly as it is the proper descriptor of peak
shapes from Raman spectra.

    WARNING: This function may return unexpected results or unreliable results for data
    that contains NaNs. Please remove any NaN values prior to passing data.

    Args:
        x_data (list like): The x-values of the spectra from which peaks will be detected.
